## How it Works

The process is designed to be simple and efficient:

1. Upload: You upload a PDF document (such as a textbook chapter or lecture notes).
2. Process: The AI analyzes the text and identifies the most important concepts and facts.
3. Generate: With one click, the system creates a set of flashcards or a multiple-choice quiz based specifically on that document.
4. Study: You can immediately start reviewing the cards or testing your knowledge with the quiz.

## Key Features

### Document Library
Keep all your study materials organized in one place. You can upload multiple documents and manage them through a clean dashboard.

### AI Assistant Actions
Beyond generating materials, the AI assistant can help you break down complex files:
- Generate Summary: Get a concise, high-level overview of your entire document instantly.
- Explain a Concept: Enter any specific topic or term from your notes to get a detailed, easy-to-understand explanation from the AI.

### AI Flashcard Generator
Instead of writing your own flashcards, the AI picks out key terms and explanations from your PDF. These are presented in an interactive flip-card format to help with memorization.

### Smart Quizzes
The system generates multiple-choice questions to test your understanding. It provides instant feedback so you can see which areas you need to review again.

### Progress Tracking
The dashboard shows you how much of each document you have reviewed. It tracks your scores and activity so you can stay on top of your learning goals.

### Chat with Document
If you have a specific question about your file, you can use the built-in AI chat. It uses the content of your document to provide accurate answers, acting like a personal tutor that has read your notes.
